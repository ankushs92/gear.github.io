My name is Hoang NT, my friends call me "professor"... because I am (sadly) 
the smallest guy in my gym group. These are things that I love:

- Culture (esp. Japanese culture)
- Hiking
- Theories (more like _understanding_ theories)
- Books
- My family and friends
- The sky (esp. in Tokyo)

### my story

I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam. Growing up I thought that I would become a doctor.
Back then, due to the lack of child-friendly entertainment methods, I had to read
Easten medical books and old physic books translated from Russian. Despite thinking
about medical school all the time, for some 
reason, I enrolled in the physics program for gifted high school students. 
Then later, I studied Electronics and Computer Science Engineering in college.
Now, I am a master student at Tokyo Institute of Technology studing complex
network and theoretical machine learning. I learn to be thankful for my journey
until now.
