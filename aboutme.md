### <i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> projects
- **MANE**: Motif-Aware Network Embedding. The real world complex networks often have recurring
patterns known as network motifs. By taking the most significant (measured z-score) motif as
a guiding pattern in a network algorithm, we improved the accuracy of various machine learning
algorithms in complex networks.

- **CREST-Deep**: Compressing deep neural network by complex network analysis. This project is funded by JST.
- **2x2MESH-NOC**: Implementation of a 2-by-2 Network On Chip using FPGA technology. We implemented a fully
functional 2x2-Mesh Network-on-Chip prototype with 4 processing units (PU) connected by 4 network interface units (NI)
and 4 network routers.
