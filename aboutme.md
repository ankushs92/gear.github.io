### my short story

My name is Hoang NT (Nguyễn Thái Hoàng or Hoang Nguyen), I am a researcher in the field 
of complex network and machine learning.  I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam. Growing up I 
thought that I would become a doctor. Back then, due to the lack of child-friendly 
entertainment methods, I had to read Easten medical books and old physics books translated 
from Russian. Back in the days, Newton and Einstein were my inspiration to study physics. 
During undergrad, I discovered the wonderful world of MIT OpenCourseWare, and my breath 
was taken away by lectures from Walter Lewin, Gilbert Strangs, and Pattrick Henry Winston. 
Today, I am doing my best to study with the hope that one day I can become a professor 
who can deliver kick-ass lectures.
