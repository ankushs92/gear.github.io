### my short story

I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam. Growing up I thought that I would become a doctor.
Back then, due to the lack of child-friendly entertainment methods, I had to read
Easten medical books and old physics books translated from Russian. Back in the days,
Newton and Einstein were my inspiration to study physics. During undergrad, I discovered
the wonderful world of MIT OpenCourseWare, and my breath was taken away by lectures
from Walter Lewin, Gilbert Strangs, and Pattrick Henry Winston. Today, I am doing my
best to study with the hope that one day I can become a professor who can deliver
kick-ass lectures.
