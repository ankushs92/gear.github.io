### <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> education
- _Master of Engineering_ (MEng) - `2015-2017`.  
**Tokyo Institute of Technology**. Grade: 3.00/3.00 ([Japanese system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Japan))
- _Bachelor of Engineering_ (BEng) - `2009-2014`.  
**Hanoi University of Science and Technology**. Grade: 3.21/4.00 (Top 10%)

### <i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> projects
- **MAGE**: Motif-Aware Graph Embedding. The real world complex networks often have recurring
patterns known as network motifs. By taking the most significant (measured by z-score) motif as
a guiding pattern in a network algorithm, we improved the accuracy of various machine learning
algorithms in complex networks.   
<i class="fa fa-file-text"></i>  *Hoang Nguyen, Tsuyoshi Murata*. [Motif-Aware Network Embedding]({{site.url}}/assets/docs/motif-aware-graph-final.pdf). Paper and oral presentation, ReLIG@IJCAI-17.
- **CREST-Deep**: Compressing deep neural network by complex network analysis, funded by JST.
- **2x2MESH-NOC**: Implementation of a 2-by-2 Network On Chip using FPGA technology. We implemented a fully
functional 2x2-Mesh Network-on-Chip prototype with 4 processing units (PU) connected by 4 network interface units (NI)
and 4 network routers.
