title: Skipgram model and Word2Vec algorithm
subtitle: Another simple explaination of the framework
---

Skipgram model is powerful yet simple NLP model. Due to the notation in the
original papers, many key concepts are confusing to new readers. Therefore, there are
many wonderful blog posts and papers aim to expain the Word2Vec algorithm. 
However, personally I feel unsatified with their explainations.

(TODO: Add links to previous posts)

## Problem definition

Def prob.

- **Input**: Matrix.
- **Output**: Matrix. 
- **Assumption**: Realibility.

## Notations

| Notation | Explaination |
| :------- | :----------- |
| $$\varphi$$ | Suspection value. Higher value means the higher chance the failure happened. |
| $$\Phi$$ | Hyperparameter. Threshold for $$\varphi$$. |
| $$\Delta_i$$ | "Heart beat" signal period. |
| $$\Delta_{to}$$ | Timeout for transmission. |
| $$\Delta_{tr}$$ | Average transmission time experienced by the messages. |
| $$\alpha$$ | $$\Delta_{tr} \approx \Delta_{i} + \alpha$$ | 
| $$q$$ | Master process that monitors other process for failure dection. |
| $$p$$ | Worker process that sends "heart beat" signals. |
| $$T_D$$ | Time until q begins to suspect p permanently in case of failure happened. |
| $$\lambda_M$$ | Average mistake rate at which a failure detector generates wrong suspicions. |
| $$\lozenge P$$ | Eventually perfect failure detector class. |
| $$ susp\_level_p(t)$$ | Suspicion level of p at time t. |
| $$ T_{high} $$ | Dynamic threshold upperbounds $$susp\_level_p$$. |
| $$ T_{low} $$ | Dynamic threshold lowerbounds $$susp\_level_p$$. |
| $$ T_{last} $$ | The time when thest most recent heart beat was received. |
| $$ t_{now} $$ | The current time. |
| $$ P_{later}(t) $$ | The probability that the next heart beat will arrive after $$t$$ time unit since the last one. |
