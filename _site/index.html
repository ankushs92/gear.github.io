        <h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Hoang. I have a very weird memory from childhood. Back then, everytime I look at my friends, I look at their heads and imagine neuron network "shooting" electricity (thanks to Discovery Channel), and I am curious about how can it be like that since then. Now, I am a master student at Computer Science Department - Tokyo Institute of Technology, studying about artificial reasoning and complex network. </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>2016-Present</b> - <em><a href="https://gear.github.io/#">EEG data reasoning to measure individual thinking process.</a></em> A project of <a href="http://www.ai.cs.titech.ac.jp/">Murata Laboratory.</a> This project takes multi-layered network approach to the problem of causual analysis. The main object is to develop a realtime system that can accurately analyze an individual's one particular thinking process and give compatibility score for the individual with that particular thinking process. The project is under developement. Group member: Nguyen Thai Hoang, <a href="mailto:murata@cs.titech.ac.jp">Assoc. Prof. Tsuyoshi Murata</a>. (to be updated)</li>
  <li><b>2015-2015</b> - <em><a href="https://goo.gl/3EUsvP">Infection Net: An augmented reality game.</a></em> A project of <a href="http://www.vogue.cs.titech.ac.jp/">Koike Laboratory.</a> This project is a part of the Human Centered Informatics Courses: Project Based Learning, by Computer Science Department - Tokyo Institute of Technology. In this project, my role is to implement an electronics board that is put inside a softball. The board detects collision, free fall, spinning motion, and then sends those information to a PC using wireless Xbee modules. I also help with some other hardware and software problem in the implementation of the IR tracking camera, game asset, and game logic. The final product is called <em>Infection Net</em>, a game where you use ball to hit nodes to disconnect a network in order to prevent disease spreading out. This game is inspired by Associate Professor Tsuyoshi Murata's lecture on Epidemic Modeling.</li>
  <li><b>2013-2014</b> - <em><a href="https://goo.gl/5kh1AK">Design and evaluation of a pipelined network interface for network on chip applications.</a></em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. In the Network-on-Chip architecture, there are Network Interface modules for communication between processing elements and the network's routers. The previous design of this module uses a FIFO buffer with size of 32, and it sends the package to the router only after it received the whole package from the processing element. This problem makes Network Interface the bottle neck in the system. In this project, the pipeline architecture is applied to solve the aforementioned problem. By using two buffers with size of 16 each - one for reading, one for writing data - I have improved the throughput of the system by approximately 40%. Group member: Nguyen Van Cuong, Nguyen Thai Hoang, <a href="mailto:nam.phamngoc@hust.edu.vn">Assoc. Prof. Pham Ngoc Nam</a>.</li> 
  <li><b>2012-2013</b> - <em>Implementation of a 2-by-2 Torus Router for Network-on-Chip.</em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. In this project, a 2x2 Torus network is implemented as a result of our group's literature research on Network-on-Chip. Torus topology, with simplex links, is used as it is very simple and efficient for small network. The deadlock-free network is implemented by using Virtual Channel technique and Wormhole switching. The design is written in VHDL and implemented on Spartan 3 FPGA board. Group member: Nguyen Thai Hoang, Nguyen Ngoc Hai, <a href="mailto:nam.phamngoc@hust.edu.vn">Assoc. Prof. Pham Ngoc Nam</a>.</li>
  <li><b>2012-2012</b> - <em>Traffic classification with optical flow.</em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. The main object is to develop an embedded system on trafic camera that can classify current trafic situation. My team of 3 worked on a PC software that takes video files as input and return a classification from A to F. The software is developed in Visual Studio 2010 C++ environment with OpenCV library.</li>
