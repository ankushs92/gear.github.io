## About
     
I came across this theorem while reading [Submodular Function Maximization](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/files/krause12survey.pdf) by professor [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). This theorem, by Nemhauser et al. (1978) proved that there is a lower bound on the greedy maximization of submodular functions. The algorithm is described as:

$$ S_i = S_{i-1} \cup \{arg\,max_e \Delta (e | S_{i-1}\} $$

This equation can be understood as follow: At step i, add the element $$e$$ that maximize the marginal gain of the function given the current set $$S_{i-1}$$.

I see some people using this theme. I need to search on Github to find who use it. But I don't want to search like this. If you like this theme or using it, please give a **star** for motivation.

## Installation
* Fork the [Repo](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/fork)
* Edit `_config.yml` file.
* Remove sample posts from `_posts` folder and add yours.
* Edit `index.md` file in `about` folder.
* Change repo name to `YourUserName.github.io`    
     
That's all.

## Scaffolding    
How Ramme is organized and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder.

## Site Setup
A quick checklist of the files you’ll want to edit to get up and running.    

### Site Wide Configuration
`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each if needed:

#### title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: My Awesome Site`

#### url

Used to generate absolute urls in `sitemap.xml`, `feed.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Ramme
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Google Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered in `_config.yml`. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership) support.

---

### Navigation Links

To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window.*

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Home
  url: /

- title: Blog
  url: /blog/

- title: Projects
  url: /projects/

- title: About
  url: /about/

- title: Ramme
  url: http://taylantatli.me/Ramme
{% endhighlight %}

## Layouts and Content

Explanations of the various `_layouts` included with the theme and when to use them.

### Post and Page

These two layouts are almost similar. Only difference is page layout doesn't show date under title.

### Post Index Page

A [sample index page]({{ site.url }}/blog/) listing all blog posts. The name can be customized to your liking by editing a few references. For example, to change **Blog** to **Posts** update the following:

* In `_data/navigation.yml`: rename the title and URL to the following:
{% highlight yaml %}
  - title: Posts
    url: /posts/
{% endhighlight %}
* Rename `blog/index.md` to `posts/index.md` and update the YAML front matter accordingly.

### Thumbnails for OG and Twitter Cards

Site logo is used by [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards).

**Pro-Tip**: You need to [apply for Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) before they will begin showing up when links to your site are shared.

### Kramdown Table of Contents

To include an auto-generated **table of contents** for posts and pages, add the following `_include` before the actual content. [Kramdown will take care of the rest](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/converter/html.html#toc) and convert all headlines into list of links.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}{% include toc.html %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
