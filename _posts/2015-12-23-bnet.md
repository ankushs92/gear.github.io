_Note: Due to some unavailibity in resources, I have stopped working
on this project. However, I will continue in the future when I have better
knowledge, tools, and connection to tackle the problem here. Also, some
content will still be udpated. 2016/05/16._

I think the mystery of networks is the mystery of human brains. I have three
point of views about the human brain: biological neuronal network, brain functional
network, and artifical neural network modeling. In order to understand how
a brain works, we need to understand not only the individual operation of a single
biological neuron, but also their operation as a complex network. One of the limitation
we have today in brain research is the level of detail we can get from our
own brain. Even the most advanced fMRI technique 

## Biological neural network and neuroscience research

The researches in this branch tackle the human's (or animals') behavior in
some setting. Data from experiments are collected in various scale: from neuronal level to
fMRI voxel level to EEG/MEG recordings, or survey-based analysis. This field of research have
the potential to give us the exact model of a biological neuron and how they (or we?) learn
to do what they do. My literature research list:
