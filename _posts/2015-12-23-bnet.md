_Note: Due to some unavailibity in resources, I have stopped working
on this project. However, I will continue in the future when I have better
knowledge, tools, and connection to tackle the problem here. Also, some
content will still be udpated. 2016/05/16._

I think the mystery of networks is the mystery of human brains. I have three
point of views about the human brain: biological neuronal network, brain functional
network, and artifical neural network modeling. In order to understand how
a brain works, we need to understand not only the individual operation of a single
biological neuron, but also their operation as a complex network. One of the limitation
we have today in brain research is the level of detail we can get from our
own brain. For example, even the most advanced technique such as BOLD fMRI can only produce 
macro-level data (compared to neuronal level). Although there are many resreaches

The researches in this branch tackle the human's (or animals') behavior in
some setting. Data from experiments are collected in various scale: from neuronal level to
fMRI voxel level to EEG/MEG recordings, or survey-based analysis. This field of research have
the potential to give us the exact model of a biological neuron and how they (or we?) learn
to do what they do. My literature research list:
