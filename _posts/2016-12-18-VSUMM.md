This summary is a part of the video summarization project that I am working on.

## Problem definition

According to a review [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1198305) on video abstraction,
there are two types of video summarization: static key frames and dynamic skimming. Key frames
represent the video in the same manner as comic books, while dynamic skimming is somewhat similar
to a trailer. In this paper, the authors addressed the problem of static video summarization.

- **Input**: Set of sequential images extracted from a video clip.
- **Output**: A matrix $$W$$ of size $$n \times d$$, where n is the number of item in $$V$$. Using this feature vector, we can define a log-submodular probabilistic model on subsets of $$V$$ which favors diversity.
- **Assumption**: Since the proposed algorithm in this paper uses noise contrastive estimation, it shares the same assumption of NCE. The first assumption is the true data distribution is the model. The second assumption is the convergence of NCE estimator is guaranteed with some probability in the limit of infinite data.

To be clear, the algorithm in this paper (FLID) learns the parameters for the matrix $$W$$, 
which encodes each item onto a latent space $$d$$. In the latent space $$d$$, similar items
are considered to be similar clustered together and a subset of similar items will receive a low
probability to be selected, while a subset of diverse items will be more likely to be selected.

## Notations

| Notation | Explaination |
| :------- | :----------- |
| $$V$$ | Set of all items. |
| $$S$$ | Sub set of $$V$$. $$S \subseteq V$$ or $$S \in 2^V$$. |
| $$2^V$$ | Power set of $$V$$, this set contains all subsets of $$V$$. |
| $$F$$ | $$F: 2^V \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$$ is a **submodular** function returning a real value for a subset $$S$$. This function can be think of as a coverage function. |
| $$P(S)$$ | The probability that subset $$S$$ is selected as a representative (diverse) set. |
| $$\exp{(F(S))}$$ | A log-submodular model defined on $$F$$. $$P(S) \propto \exp{(F(S))}. |
