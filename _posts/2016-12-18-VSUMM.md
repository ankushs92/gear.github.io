This post is the summary of the paper: _**VSUMM: A mechanism designed to produce 
static video summaries and a novel evaluation method **_ by Sandra Eliza Fontes 
de Avila, Ana Paula Brandão Lopes, Antonio da Luz Jr., and Arnaldo de Albuquerque 
Araújo. In Pattern Recognition Letters 32 (2011). p56-68.

This summary is a part of the video summarization project that I am working on.

## Problem definition

According to a review [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1198305) on video abstraction,
there are two types of video summarization: static key frames and dynamic skimming. Key frames
represent the video in the same manner as comic books, while dynamic skimming is somewhat similar
to a trailer. In this paper, the authors addressed the problem of static video summarization.

- **Input**: Set of sequential static images extracted from a video clip.
- **Output**: A much smaller subset of the input set capturing the content of the video clip.
- **Assumption**: Video contents are similar when the histogram is similar. In other words, if two frames have similar colors, they have the same "meaning".

## Notations

| Notation | Explaination |
| :------- | :----------- |
| $$HSV$$ | HSV color space. |
| $$S$$ | Sub set of $$V$$. $$S \subseteq V$$ or $$S \in 2^V$$. |
| $$2^V$$ | Power set of $$V$$, this set contains all subsets of $$V$$. |
| $$F$$ | $$F: 2^V \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$$ is a **submodular** function returning a real value for a subset $$S$$. This function can be think of as a coverage function. |
| $$P(S)$$ | The probability that subset $$S$$ is selected as a representative (diverse) set. |
| $$\exp{(F(S))}$$ | A log-submodular model defined on $$F$$. $$P(S) \propto \exp{(F(S))}. |
