May the 4th be with you.

It is always exciting to start programming, whether it is a new language or a
whole new scheme. This post is my mental image of (Nvidia) GPU programming; it
belongs to my series of GPU Programming Notes:
1. Part 1: Nvidia GPU programming mental image. (this post)
2. [Part 2: Kernels and Shared Memory.]({{site.baseurl}}) (coming soon)
3. [Part 3: 2d convolutional neural network.]({{site.baseurl}}) (coming soon)
4. Coming later.
