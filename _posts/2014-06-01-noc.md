FPGA is a promising solution to numerous technological problems arised recently.
Stands for Field Programmable Gate Array, FPGA can be simply understood as
an IC which can be configured by a designer (I do not prefer the word _programmed_ 
as it can be confused with software programming). Since 2012, I has been
working and studying with professor Pham Ngoc Nam at Hanoi University of
Science and Technology about FPGA-related topics. In our laboratory, FPGA boards
are used as a prototype platform for IC designs prototyping. My undergraduate
thesis is about "Network on Chip", my part is to design a new Network Interface
that allows higher communication bandwidth between the Network Router and the
Network Processing Unit (_higher_ compared to existing designs).

The published paper and thesis is written in Vietnamese. However, the English
version of the paper can be found [here](ATC_2014_draft.pdf). 

### The problem we try to solve

Before talking about the problem, I believe I need to provide the reader
with some context. As I mentioned above, the FPGA
