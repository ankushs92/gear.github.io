## What is network motifs?

![Motifs]({{site.baseurl}}/img/motif_triangles.png){:width="70%" .center-small}

Network motif can be seen as a subgraph pattern of a complex network (Milo 2002). 
For example, in a citation network, if we consider three weakly connected nodes, 
we can find the patterns where two nodes point to the other one or one nodes points 
to the other two quite frequently. In biology system studies, researchers care 
about such statistically significant motifs. Systems such as gene transcription 
network or ecological food web exhibits a significant motifs count (for some motifs) 
compared to a random network with the same number nodes and links (Milo 2002).
