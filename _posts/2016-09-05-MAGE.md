title: Motif-Aware Graph Embedding
subtitle: The benefit of guilding random walks by motifs

Recently, the field of graph embedding takes off by the adaptation of [Skipgram](https://)
model on graphs. The pioneer paper named [Deepwalk: bla bla](https://) on this topic is 
published in KDD'14 by Peperozi et al. I [presented](https://) this paper at a meet up at 
University of Tokyo on graph embedding in early 2016. In a nutshell, graph embedding _is_
word embedding. Viewing words in a novel and vertices in a graph as a same entity, the 
algorithm to learn a projection of a word token to some d-dimension real vector space can
be applied to a vertex in a graph. Thanks to some similarity between the frequency of
verticies in random walks and words count in text, the authors of _Deepwalk_ has proposed
to use random walks on a graph as a tool to generate the _graph context_. For me, I view
such scheme as a duality. (I **love** duality)
