I am a Master student in Computer Science Department at Tokyo Institute of Techonology under MEXT scholarship.
     
I like Japanese food, Japanese tradition, Japanese stories, Japanese people, and Japanese martial art. Well, pretty much everything about Japan.
     
I enjoy proving theorems, and learning new (mostly computer related) skills.

I think the most important thing in life is family and friends.
