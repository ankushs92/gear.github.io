My group's design is an optimized version of seniors in ESRC Lab's previous work. By applying pipeline technique, we are able to increase throughput of the Network Interface by 40\% compare to our seniors' version. Further more, the network itself can handle much more data due to new structure of our Mesh-Router.}

I was born and raised in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam. I did not show many potential as an elementary student, but thanks to my parent's consistency in educating me I was accepted in the Hanoi National University of Education's High School for Gifted Student. Later, I decided to choose Hanoi University of Science and Technology as a place to pursue higher education because I want to be an engineer. My ideology and personality was developed mostly during my university life. In my freshman year, I read "An Encouragement of Learning" written by Fukuzawa Yukichi. The book and Fukuzawa Yukichi's idea influence me deeply. I believe everyone, whoever has the desire, has the right to learn and the most powerful tool in life is the self-learning ability. Thanks to Coursera and MIT Open Course Ware, I had the opportunity to learn new knowledge that my university can not provide. I found myself with great interest in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining field and started to learn online courses in my leisured time. My dream is to be able to create an artificial brain that can learn and reason about real life situations. Besides learning, I am a quiet person with passion for Kendo. I enjoy practicing and thinking about Kendo almost all day because I find good qualities I wanted for myself when I do Kendo. Recently, my Kendo team was the runner-up in the 1st Morikawa Kendo Tournament in Hanoi. I also enjoy cycling and I hope one day I can cycle cross Vietnam and then cross Japan. My favorite quote is from a Disney animation film and from Walt Disney himself: "Keep moving forward".
