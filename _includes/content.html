<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Hoang. I have a very weird memory from childhood. Back then, everytime I look at my friends, I look at their heads and imagine neuron network "shooting" electricity. Now, I am a master student at Computer Science Department - Tokyo Institute of Technology, studying about artificial reasoning and complex network. </p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>2015-Present</b> - <em>Tokyo Institute of Technology.</em> Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering - Department of Computer Science. Murata Laboratory.</li>
  <li><b>2014-2015</b> - <em>Donuts Hanoi Co, Ltd.</em> Intern as software developer in Gachiko no Tora game project.</li>
  <li><b>2009-2014</b> - <em>Hanoi University of Science and Technology.</em> School of Electronics and Telecommunication - Department of Computer Engineering. ESRC Laboratory.</li>
  <li><b>2006-2009</b> - <em>Highschool for Gifted Student - Hanoi University of Education.</em> Physics class - K40. Physics National Olympiad Team. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>2013-2014</b> - <em><a href="https://goo.gl/5kh1AK">Design and evaluation of a pipelined network interface for network on chip applications.</a></em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. </li> 
  <li><b>2012-2013</b> - <em>Implementation of a 2-by-2 Torus Router for Network-on-Chip.</em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. In this project, a 2x2 Torus network is implemented as a result of our group's literature research on Network-on-Chip. Torus topology, with simplex links, is used as it is very simple and efficient for small network. The deadlock-free network is implemented by using Virtual Channel technique and Wormhole switching. The design is written in VHDL and implemented on Spartan 3 FPGA board.</li>
  <li><b>2012-2012</b> - <em>Traffic classification with optical flow.</em> A project of ESRC Laboratory. The objective is to develop an embedded system on trafic camera that can classify current trafic situation. My team of 3 worked on a PC software that takes video files as input and return a classification from A to F. The software is developed in Visual Studio 2010 C++ environment with OpenCV library.</li>
